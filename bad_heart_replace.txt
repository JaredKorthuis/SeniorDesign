When a heart has been determined as in crtical failing conditions,
they are suggested having an artificial heart replacement. The reason that
it would be a full heart replacement instead of a valve replacement could be because
the patient is either above the age of 45, or because the health status of the patient is too weak.
When having an artificial heart replacement, most of the time, it causes the patient's
way of life to change drastically. Sometimes they might be confined to a chair,
or not exercise excessively anymore. For more information click the link below.
