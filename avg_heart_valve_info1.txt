Some people with heart conditions might not need to have a complete heart replacement.
People that are under the age of 45 have been known to have artificial heart valve replacements.
This is when the heart valves are replaced with artificial ones. 
Over the course of time and healing, the artificial valves may be replaced with natural tissue.
